* Video Picker

This is a Python/Gtk+3/Gstreamer-based application, written for my thesis on
social robots, to build the dataset.

Given a video with subtitles and metadata from ~ffprobe~ about the shots in a
video, this extracts an image sequence corresponsing to every sentence in the
subtitles.

** Requirements

*** Fedora: Rebuilding ~gstreamer1-plugins-good~

The Fedora pagage ~gstreamer1-plugins-good~ has the Gstreamer ~cairo~ plugin
disabled, so we need to modify that and build it ourselves.

A specfile based on version 1.12.4-1 is included in this repo.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo dnf install rpm-build
dnf download --source gstreamer1-plugins-good
rpm -i gstreamer1-plugins-good-1.12.4-1.fc27.src.rpm
cd ~/rpmbuild/SPECS
vim gstreamer1-plugins-good.spec
# Enable cairo, add dependencies (for 1.12.4-1, you can use the specfile in this repo)
sudo dnf builddep gstreamer1-plugins-good.spec
rpmbuild -ba gstreamer1-plugins-good.spec
sudo rpm -U ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/gstreamer1-plugins-good-1.12.4-2.fc27.x86_64.rpm
#+END_SRC
